# OpenAI Assistant Fixed Routes Integration

## Enhanced Action Code

Your OpenAI Assistant action code has been updated with complete fixed route management capabilities:

### New Functions Added to DriverSchedulingClient:

```python
# Fixed Route Management Functions
def create_fixed_route(self, driver_name: str, route_pattern: str, priority: int = 1, 
                      day_of_week: str = "any", notes: str = "") -> Dict[str, Any]

def get_fixed_routes(self) -> Dict[str, Any]

def update_fixed_route(self, fixed_route_id: int, driver_name: str, route_pattern: str, 
                      priority: int = 1, day_of_week: str = "any", notes: str = "") -> Dict[str, Any]

def delete_fixed_route(self, fixed_route_id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

## Complete Working API Endpoints

### 1. CREATE Fixed Route
```bash
POST /api/v1/assistant/create-fixed-route
```

**Example Usage in Actions:**
```python
client = DriverSchedulingClient("YOUR_API_URL")
result = client.create_fixed_route(
    driver_name="Klagenfurt - Samstagsfahrer",
    route_pattern="452SA",
    priority=1,
    day_of_week="saturday",
    notes="Traditional Saturday route"
)
```

### 2. READ All Fixed Routes
```bash
GET /api/v1/assistant/fixed-routes
```

**Example Usage in Actions:**
```python
result = client.get_fixed_routes()
# Returns all fixed route assignments with driver names
```

### 3. UPDATE Fixed Route
```bash
PUT /api/v1/assistant/fixed-routes/{fixed_route_id}
```

**Example Usage in Actions:**
```python
result = client.update_fixed_route(
    fixed_route_id=1,
    driver_name="Bandzi, Attila",
    route_pattern="452SA",
    priority=2,
    day_of_week="saturday",
    notes="Updated to backup driver"
)
```

### 4. DELETE Fixed Route
```bash
DELETE /api/v1/assistant/fixed-routes/{fixed_route_id}
```

**Example Usage in Actions:**
```python
result = client.delete_fixed_route(fixed_route_id=1)
# Removes the fixed assignment, route will be optimized normally
```

### 5. Manual Optimization Trigger
```bash
POST /api/v1/assistant/optimize-week
```

**After any fixed route changes:**
```python
result = client.optimize_week("2025-07-07")
# Applies fixed routes first, then optimizes remaining routes
# Updates Google Sheets automatically
```

## IMPORTANT: Reset Behavior

### Question: Do fixed routes stay after reset?
**Answer: YES - Fixed routes remain intact after system reset.**

### What Reset DOES Clear:
- All driver-route assignments
- Manually added routes (preserves original system routes)
- Driver availability (resets to available for weekdays, unavailable for Sunday)

### What Reset DOES NOT Clear:
- **Fixed route assignments** (these stay in the database)
- Original system routes
- Driver information
- System configuration

### Code Evidence:
Looking at the reset function in `api/routes/assistant_api.py`, lines 374-402:

```python
# Clear all assignments
await conn.execute("DELETE FROM assignments")

# Clear routes that were added via API (preserves original system data)
await conn.execute("""
    DELETE FROM routes 
    WHERE date BETWEEN '2025-07-07' AND '2025-07-13' 
    AND created_at > '2025-08-11 21:10:00'
""")

# Reset driver availability
await conn.execute("""
    UPDATE driver_availability 
    SET available = true 
    WHERE date BETWEEN '2025-07-07' AND '2025-07-12'
""")

# NO DELETE of fixed_driver_routes table - they persist!
```

## Workflow After Reset

1. **Reset System**: Clears assignments and availability
2. **Fixed Routes Remain**: Your configured assignments stay in database
3. **Run Optimization**: Fixed routes are applied first, then OR-Tools optimizes
4. **Google Sheets Updated**: Complete driver grid with fixed assignments

## Business Value

- **Traditional Assignments Protected**: Saturday specialists always get their routes
- **Business Rules Preserved**: Important driver-route relationships maintained
- **Flexible Reset**: Can reset system state without losing business logic
- **Immediate Recovery**: After reset, fixed routes are immediately applied in next optimization

## Current Status

Your system currently has **3 active fixed route assignments**:
- Bandzi, Attila → Route "400" (Saturday)
- Genäuß, Thomas → Route "431oS" (Monday)
- Klagenfurt - Samstagsfahrer → Route "452SA" (Saturday)

These will persist through any system reset and be applied automatically in every optimization run.

## Integration Steps

1. Update your OpenAI Assistant action code with the enhanced DriverSchedulingClient
2. Use the new fixed route management functions in your assistant workflows
3. Always call `optimize_week()` after making fixed route changes
4. Fixed routes will automatically be applied in every subsequent optimization

Your complete driver scheduling system now supports both business rule preservation (fixed routes) and mathematical optimization (remaining routes) with full persistence through system resets.
