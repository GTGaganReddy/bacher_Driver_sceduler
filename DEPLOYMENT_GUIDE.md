# Deployment Guide - Driver Scheduling Backend

## Quick Fix for Deployment Issues

Your application is now deployment-ready! Here are the improvements made and troubleshooting steps:

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Enhanced Startup Configuration**
- Added Cloud Run optimized uvicorn settings
- Improved timeout handling (30s keep-alive, 30s graceful shutdown)  
- Better error handling during startup
- Automatic deployment environment detection

### 2. **Improved Health Checks**
- `/healthz` - Fast response for deployment health checks
- `/ready` - Kubernetes/Cloud Run readiness probe
- `/live` - Kubernetes/Cloud Run liveness probe
- Root endpoint (`/`) includes database connectivity check

### 3. **Alternative Startup Scripts**
- `start.py` - Cloud Run optimized startup script
- `main.py` - Enhanced with deployment-specific error handling
- `deploy_test.py` - Pre-deployment validation script

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Use Enhanced main.py (Recommended)
```bash
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Use Deployment-Optimized start.py
```bash
python start.py
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Port Binding
**Error**: Service not accessible
**Solution**: Cloud Run automatically sets `PORT` env var - our code handles this

### Issue 2: Health Check Timeouts  
**Error**: Deployment health checks fail
**Solution**: Use `/healthz` endpoint - optimized for quick response

### Issue 3: Database Connection
**Error**: Database connection fails on startup
**Solution**: Ensure `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set

### Issue 4: Dependencies
**Error**: Import errors or missing packages
**Solution**: All dependencies are in `pyproject.toml` - they auto-install

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

Run this test to verify deployment readiness:

```bash
python deploy_test.py
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Database connection successful
‚úÖ All critical imports successful  
‚úÖ FastAPI app created successfully
‚úÖ Root endpoint responds
‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSED - Ready for deployment
```

## üåê Environment Variables

Required for deployment:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Supabase PostgreSQL connection string

Optional (auto-detected):
- `PORT` - Set automatically by Cloud Run
- `K_SERVICE` - Cloud Run service detection
- `CLOUD_RUN_SERVICE` - Alternative Cloud Run detection

## üîç Debugging Deployment Issues

If deployment still fails:

1. **Check Logs**: Look for specific error messages in deployment logs
2. **Test Health Endpoint**: Verify `/healthz` responds with 200 status
3. **Database Connection**: Ensure DATABASE_URL is accessible from Cloud Run
4. **Port Issues**: Verify app binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`, not localhost

## üìû Next Steps

1. Try deploying again using the enhanced configuration
2. If issues persist, share the specific error message from deployment logs
3. The deployment test confirms everything works locally

Your application is now optimized for Cloud Run deployment with proper error handling, health checks, and timeout management.
