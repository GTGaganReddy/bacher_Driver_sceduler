## Complete Workflow Example

### Step 1: Create Fixed Route
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/assistant/create-fixed-route" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "driver_name": "GenÃ¤uÃŸ, Thomas",
    "route_pattern": "431oS",
    "priority": 1,
    "day_of_week": "monday",
    "notes": "Experienced driver for Monday routes"
  }'
```

### Step 2: Rerun Optimization and Update Sheets
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/assistant/optimize-week" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"week_start": "2025-07-07"}'
```

This triggers:
1. Enhanced OR-Tools optimization (fixed routes first, then optimization)
2. Database assignment updates
3. Google Sheets update with complete driver grid

## Real Test Data

Your system has these drivers available for fixed route assignments:
- "Klagenfurt - Samstagsfahrer" (Saturday specialist)
- "GenÃ¤uÃŸ, Thomas" (Experienced driver)
- "FrÃ¶hlacher, Hubert"
- "Bandzi, Attila"
- "Blaskovic, Nenad"
- And 16 other authentic drivers

Common route patterns:
- "452SA", "451SA" (Saturday routes)
- "431oS", "432oS", "433oS", "434oS" (Weekday routes)
- "437oS", "438oS", "439oS", "440oS" (Additional weekday routes)
- "400", "EXPRESS" (Special routes)

The system successfully processes 39 real routes with authentic driver assignments and updates your Google Sheets automatically.
