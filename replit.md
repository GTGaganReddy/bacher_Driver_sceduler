# Overview

This is a FastAPI-based logistics driver scheduling backend system that uses OR-Tools optimization to automatically assign drivers to routes based on availability. The system integrates with Google Sheets via Google Cloud Function for automatic schedule updates and uses Supabase PostgreSQL for authentic data persistence. The application optimizes weekly driver schedules for the July 7-13, 2025 period using 21 real drivers and authentic route data, then automatically posts results to Google Sheets via the user's Google Cloud Function.

# Recent Changes

## August 12, 2025 - Deployment Optimization & Health Check Enhancements
- **Fixed deployment configuration**: Updated port handling to use PORT environment variable
- **Enhanced root endpoint**: Added "status": "healthy" to root endpoint for deployment health checks
- **Added rapid health check**: New `/healthz` endpoint for quick deployment health verification
- **Improved logging**: Added port information to startup logs for better deployment debugging
- **Port configuration fix**: Updated settings.py to default to port 5000 for Replit deployments
- **Deployment ready**: All suggested fixes applied for cloud deployment compatibility

## August 12, 2025 - Complete OpenAI Assistant Integration with 422 Error Resolution
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved all 422 request format errors for OpenAI Assistant integration
- Added simplified endpoints: `/update-driver-availability` and `/add-single-route`
- Both user request formats now work perfectly (driver availability + route addition)
- Comprehensive OpenAI Assistant action code with full API integration  
- Implemented system reset endpoint for clearing assignments and resetting availability
- Created complete natural language interface for all scheduling operations
- F entry functionality fully operational (unavailable drivers show as route="F")
- Built comprehensive setup documentation and demo scripts
- All six Assistant API endpoints now fully operational with simplified request formats
- Complete data flow verified: API requests → OR-Tools optimization → Google Sheets export
- 46 total routes successfully managed with dynamic assignment optimization

## August 11, 2025 - Sequential OR-Tools Algorithm Implementation
- Replaced progressive algorithm with true sequential optimization approach
- Day-by-day chronological processing: solves each date independently in order
- Dynamic capacity tracking: updates remaining driver hours between each day's optimization
- Multiple solver instances: creates fresh SCIP solver for each day's route assignments
- Real-time hour consumption: capacity reduces after each assignment for subsequent days
- More realistic modeling: mirrors actual schedule building process (day-by-day)
- Maintains Saturday route 452SA assignment to Klagenfurt - Samstagsfahrer
- Pure OR-Tools SCIP solver with sequential mathematical programming approach

# System Architecture

## Backend Framework
- **FastAPI**: RESTful API framework with automatic OpenAPI documentation
